# ClassicAlgorithms

A collection of classic computer science algorithms implemented in pure [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/max/mojo) `version 24.4.0`. This repo is meant as a learning exercise to cover the various aspects of the Mojo language and not as a comprehensive overview or instruction manual of the various algorithms detailed below.
